        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects (data structures containing both data and methods) rather than functions and logic, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, specifying their attributes (data) and methods (functions). Classes enable code reuse, modularity, and organization, making complex systems easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit that encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and the actions (methods or behaviors) that can be performed on that data, representing a real-world entity or concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In object-oriented programming, abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features, while encapsulation bundles data and methods within a class, controlling access to ensure data protection and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They provide a way to implement operator overloading and customize the behavior of classes. These methods are automatically called by the Python interpreter in response to certain operations or events.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (base or parent class), promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and code reusability by allowing multiple classes to implement the same method in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Encapsulation in Python is achieved through access modifiers and naming conventions, which control the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods). While Python doesn't have strict access control like some other languages (e.g., Java's private), it uses conventions to indicate the intended scope of members.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is automatically called when an object is created. The constructor's primary purpose is to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes. In Python, the constructor is named __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, class methods are bound to the class itself (not instances) and can access class attributes, while static methods are functions within a class that don't have access to either class or instance data, serving as utility functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but with different parameters. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense like some other languages such as Java or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, enabling specialized behavior while maintaining the same method signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> In Python, a property decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute within a class, while still allowing access to it using the dot notation. This mechanism enables controlled access and modification of class attributes, promoting better code organization and data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting adaptable and modular software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines methods that subclasses must implement, ensuring a consistent interface. Abstract classes are created using the abc module and the ABC class as a metaclass. Abstract methods within an abstract class are declared using the @abstractmethod decorator and do not have an implementation in the abstract class itself. Subclasses are then required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers advantages like improved code organization through encapsulation, reusability via inheritance, and flexibility with polymorphism, simplifying complex systems and promoting modular, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Class variables are useful for storing data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or default values. Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a class can combine behaviors and characteristics from multiple sources, creating a more versatile and feature-rich class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> __str__(self): This method returns a user-friendly, informal string representation of an object. It's called by the str() built-in function and implicitly used by the print() function. The goal of __str__ is to provide a readable output for end-users. If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to using __repr__.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> __repr__(self): This method returns a more detailed, unambiguous string representation of an object, primarily intended for developers and debugging. It's called by the repr() built-in function. Ideally, the string returned by __repr__ should be able to recreate the object when passed to eval(), although this isn't always feasible or necessary. If __repr__ is defined and __str__ is not, __repr__ will be used for both str() and repr() calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass. It provides a way to access and utilize inherited methods, promoting code reuse and maintainability, especially in complex inheritance hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -> The __del__ method, also known as a destructor, in Python is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It provides a last opportunity for the object to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing files. However, relying heavily on __del__ is generally discouraged due to its unpredictable timing and potential issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> @staticmethod:\n",
        "This decorator defines a method that is independent of the class and its instances. It behaves like a regular function, but it's logically grouped within the class. Static methods don't receive the implicit first argument (self or cls). They cannot access or modify the class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> @classmethod:\n",
        "This decorator defines a method that receives the class itself as the first argument (cls). Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes but cannot directly access instance-specific attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Polymorphism in Python, in the context of inheritance, enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. This is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (self) after performing its operation. This allows for a more concise and readable way to perform a sequence of actions on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class defines the __call__ method, its instances become callable objects. This means you can use parentheses to \"call\" the instance, triggering the execution of the code within the __call__ method.\n",
